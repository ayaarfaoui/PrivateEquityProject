# Private Equity Project

##  Project Overview
This project analyzes **Private Equity (PE) investment strategies** across different stages of the business lifecycle. It focuses on multiple companies to illustrate how PE approaches vary depending on growth, maturity, and financial challenges.

The objective is to evaluate potential investment opportunities, risks, and exit strategies, using **common financial ratios** rather than in-depth financial modeling.

##  Companies & PE Subsets
- **Venture Capital (VC)**: *Mistral AI* – early-stage investment in a promising AI startup.
- **Growth Equity (GE)**: *Canva* – expansion financing for a fast-scaling design platform.
- **Buyout (LBO)**: *FedEx* – leveraged buyout analysis for a mature global logistics company.
- **Alternative Strategy (Distressed Debt)**: *Vice Media* – turnaround potential through distressed debt investment.

##  Tools & Methods
- Common financial ratios (profitability, leverage, liquidity)
- Industry/market research
- Risk-return assessment
- PE strategic frameworks
